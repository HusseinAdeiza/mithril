# Mithril client library example: Cardano block

## Description

This example shows how to implement a Mithril client and use its features related to the `Cardano Block` type.

In this example, the client interacts with an aggregator and performs the following operations:

- Retrieve cryptographic proofs of membership of the Cardano blocks set for a list of blocks passed as arguments
- Verify the validity of the proofs
- Verify the validity of the validity of the certificate chain attached to the proofs
- Verify that the certificate chain signs a message computed from the proof

The certificate chain can be verified with the certificate chain cache (unstable), which stores the verified certificates in a directory so that the next executions reuse them:

- `--use-certificate-chain-cache`: enable the certificate chain cache
- `--certificate-chain-cache-mode`: verification mode, either `FullVerification` (default, cached certificates are re-verified) or `EarlyStopVerification` (the verification stops at the first cached certificate)
- `--certificate-chain-cache-path`: directory of the cache (default `./certificate-chain-cache`)

> [!CAUTION]
> In the `EarlyStopVerification` mode, the cache is part of the trust base of the client: the directory of the cache must be protected against tampering.

## Build and run the example

```bash
# Build from the crate directory
cargo build

# Run from the crate directory
AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT=YOUR_AGGREGATOR_ENDPOINT GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY=YOUR_GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY cargo run CARDANO_BLOCK_HASH1,CARDANO_BLOCK_HASH2,CARDANO_BLOCK_HASH3

# Example with from 'testing-preview' network
